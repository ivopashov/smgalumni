The site relies on uptimerobot.com for scheduled wake-up calls.

All the mail sending functionality (forgot password and other notifications) as well as the newsletter functionality is outsourced to mailgun.com,
which is a mail and newsletter service by rackspace and is free for up to 10,000 mails per month as of the time of this writing. That suits our needs.

As of the time of this writing we have the following jobs scheduled to run in specific intervals:
- DeleteAbandonedAttachments- that is when you go ahead to create a listing and attach some files to it but close the dialog without saving the listing, the attachments end up abandoned - runs every 3600 sec
- UnsentNotificationSender - 120 sec
- UsersToNewsLetterSubscriber - looks for registered users and subscribes them to the newsletter automatically - runs every 7200 sec
- BiMonthlyNewsLetterSender - sends the bimonthly newsletter to subscribed users - runs every 3600 sec but returns if day is not 14-th or 28-th
