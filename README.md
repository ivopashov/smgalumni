this is the site for the smg alumni network

This site is intended to provide a common collaboratin space for alumni of SMG high school Sofia. The site provides
registration functionality, account managament, search for people, news, charity campaigns, forum, peer-to-peer ads, notifications.

It can be used for any alumni networks with little to no modification. Currently supported language is Bulgarian only but i will push to introduce english for the future.

The site is open source and can be used by any alumni charter totally free of charge but only for the purpose it was created for - b a platform for alumni collaboration. Only requirement is to mention the creator of this repository. 

ATM this site is developped solely by me (Ivaylo Pashov) but i will utilize pull requests in the future.
